I'm trying something new to get more visibility to upcoming potential 
website changes, as well as recent website changes. I probably won't 
include the introductory material each time, but it's worth explaining 
what I'm doing the first time. The purpose is both to get a wider 
audience for the discussion of changes and to inform people what's going 
on. 

I'm thinking I'll produce these every other week or so, depending on the 
pace of development, my free time, and what kind of response I get. 

My criteria for inclusion are 

* User facing: I won't generally include changes that aren't visible on 
osm.org 

* Changes in functionality: I won't count changes that are purely bug 
fixes or changes that aren't apparent to the user 

* Noticeable: There are lots of minor changes to the website to fix 
minor issues. Many of these are immediately merged. 

* Would benefit from comments: I only include changes that stand a 
reasonable chance of being merged in the near future, or changes that 
would benefit from a wider audience 

Feedback on these criteria is welcome, but I have no intention of 
posting every little website change to the list. If you want that, 
follow the issue trackers. 

Most changes are in the openstreetmap-website project at 
https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website although I will 
include other projects if I'm aware of interesting changes.
